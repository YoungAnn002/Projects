                <p>Healthy ecosystems depend on plant and animal species as their foundations. When a species becomes endangered, it is a sign that the ecosystem 
                    is slowly falling apart. Each species that is lost triggers the loss of other species within its ecosystem. Humans depend on healthy ecosystems 
                    to purify our environment.

                <li>Over the last 150 years, the tigers' range has shrunk by nearly 95%. There are estimated to be around 3,900 tigers left in the wild.</li>

                <li>Around 3,000 of the world's tigers are in India</li>
                <li>Tigers primarily hunt deer, but as opportunistic predators, they can also eat wild boars, birds, fish, rodents, amphibians, reptiles, and even 
                    insects. A large deer can provide a tiger with one week's food, but only one out of every ten hunts is successful.

                    <li>Orangutans have an arm span of about 2.2 m (over 7 ft) from fingertip to fingertip.   Considering their standing height is around 
                        1. 5 m, this is an impressive reach. Their arms are so long in fact that they’re one and a half times longer than their legs and 
                        stretch to their ankles when standing. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Orangutans are incredibly dexterous and use both hands and feet while gathering food and travelling through the trees. Like us, 
                        orangutans have four fingers and a thumb, and fingernails. Their feet look almost exactly the same as their hands – designed for 
                        agile climbing and gripping.
