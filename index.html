                <p>Healthy ecosystems depend on plant and animal species as their foundations. When a species becomes endangered, it is a sign that the ecosystem 
                    is slowly falling apart. Each species that is lost triggers the loss of other species within its ecosystem. Humans depend on healthy ecosystems 
                    to purify our environment.

                <li>Over the last 150 years, the tigers' range has shrunk by nearly 95%. There are estimated to be around 3,900 tigers left in the wild.</li>
                <li>There are more tigers in captivity in the US than are left in the wild</li>
                <li>Around 3,000 of the world's tigers are in India</li>
                <li>Tigers primarily hunt deer, but as opportunistic predators, they can also eat wild boars, birds, fish, rodents, amphibians, reptiles, and even 
                    insects. A large deer can provide a tiger with one week's food, but only one out of every ten hunts is successful.
                </li>
                <li>Tigers don't usually eat their prey at the kill site - but instead drag their prey into cover to feed. If a tiger leaves - say to get a drink - 
                    it will cover it's kill by raking leaves, dirt, grass and even rocks over the carcass. </li>

                <li>There are 5 species of rhino in the world These include two African rhino species - black and white rhinos.</li>
                <li>Rhinos can weigh over 3 tonnes</li>
                <li>Male rhinos are called 'bulls' and females are called 'cows'. Their young are 'calves'. </li>
                <li>Females tend to be more sociable than the more solitary, territorial males. Together, a group of rhinos is called a 'crash'. </li>
                <li>Rhinos make an array of funny noises when they’re communicating.   During confrontations, they growl and make 'trumpet calls'.  Black rhinos snort when they’re angry, 
                    make sneeze-like calls as alarms, scream if they’re scared and ‘mmwonk' when relaxed.    Rhinos also communicate through their poo and urine. When rhino poo in the same 
                    place as other rhinos – an area known as a latrine – they can smell the poo and urine of other individuals, and know who's in the area.  </li>

                    <li>Orangutans have an arm span of about 2.2 m (over 7 ft) from fingertip to fingertip.   Considering their standing height is around 
                        1. 5 m, this is an impressive reach. Their arms are so long in fact that they’re one and a half times longer than their legs and 
                        stretch to their ankles when standing. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Orangutans are incredibly dexterous and use both hands and feet while gathering food and travelling through the trees. Like us, 
                        orangutans have four fingers and a thumb, and fingernails. Their feet look almost exactly the same as their hands – designed for 
                        agile climbing and gripping.
